# Archival Purpose & Preservation Statement

The Furuniverse Reality Basement Collection is preserved to document the
development of a long-running fictional worldbuilding project.

Some materials originate from early drafts, exploratory notes, or experimental
concepts. They are retained to show the creative evolution of the setting rather
than as finalized canon.

This archive is not intended as instruction, advocacy, or commentary on
real-world systems. It exists purely as speculative fiction and creative record.

Preservation efforts may include reorganizing files, adding metadata, or
creating mirrors while keeping original documents intact.
