FURORIA TECHNOLOGY, CIVILIZATION, AND TRANSPORT TIMELINE
Railroad, Transport, Aviation, Space, Interplanetary, Interdimensional, and Automotive Development
Calendar System: BZE (Before Zero Event) / ZE (Zero Event and After)
Location: Furoria, Primary Anthro Civilization World

BIOLOGICAL STANDARD OF FURORIA CITIZENS
------------------------------------------------------------

All anthropomorphic citizens of Furoria possess plantigrade lower body anatomy. This means the entire foot — heel, arch, and toes — makes contact with the ground during walking and standing.

Their feet are structurally human-like in posture, balance, and load distribution.

Digitigrade anatomy does not naturally occur in Furoria citizens.

This plantigrade anatomical standard has remained stable and unchanged throughout all known eras of Furoria civilization, from prehistoric ages to the present trans-dimensional era.

Plantigrade anatomy provides the following functional advantages:

- Stable upright posture
- Efficient long-distance walking and standing
- Improved balance and endurance
- Precise control of vehicles and machinery
- Reduced fatigue during extended operation of transport systems
- Long-term compatibility with standardized infrastructure

Because this anatomical structure has remained constant for trillions of years, all transportation systems, vehicles, and control mechanisms were designed around plantigrade operators.
