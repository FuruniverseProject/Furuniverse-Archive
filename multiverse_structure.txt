MULTIVERSE STRUCTURE — FURUNIVERSE
=================================

The Furuniverse is structured as an open-ended multiversal network.

Dimensions differ in:

• physics
• ecology
• civilization scale
• technology
• resource density
• visibility of everyday systems

Some realities appear expansive and detailed.
Others are minimal, symbolic, or selectively rendered.

No dimension is designed to replicate real-world Earth.
