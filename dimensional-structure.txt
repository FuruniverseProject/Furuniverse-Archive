Title: Multiversal Mechanics and Dimensional Rules

This document explores how dimensions, realities, and parallel universes function within the Furuniverse setting. It addresses differences in physical laws, environmental density, technological visibility, and the way everyday objects and wildlife manifest in various worlds.

Some dimensions are described as sparse or restrained, others expansive, but none are empty. Existence continues according to local rules rather than disappearing entirely.

This text serves as a framework for understanding how the Furuniverse relates to other fictional realities.
