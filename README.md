# Furuniverse Reality Basement Collection

An archival repository preserving fictional worldbuilding materials from the Furuniverse — a multiversal creative setting centered on anthropomorphic civilizations, planetary systems, dimensional structures, and speculative continuity.

This project is presented as documentation and narrative design rather than real-world belief. It includes scanned notes, rewritten summaries, diagrams, images, and multi-part PDF volumes that explore the internal logic of the setting.

## 📘 What Is the Furuniverse?

The Furuniverse is a fictional cosmology in which reality is structured differently across dimensions. Worlds vary in how densely wildlife, everyday objects, and background life appear — sometimes restrained, sometimes understated, but never absent.

Technology, culture, and species evolve independently in each realm, producing environments unlike those found in our own reality. These materials serve as an evolving reference archive for that universe.
