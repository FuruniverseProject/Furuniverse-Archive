# Furuniverse Reality Basement Collection  
### Foundational Worldbuilding Archive

This repository preserves and organizes the **Furuniverse Reality Basement Collection** — a long-form fictional worldbuilding project exploring alternate realities, anthropomorphic civilizations, planetary systems, and multiversal structure.

The Furuniverse is an original speculative setting where existence operates differently from our own. Worlds, species, technology, environments, and everyday objects follow internal dimensional rules rather than real-world history or physics. Wildlife and minor creatures are present but often subtle or selectively visible, and daily life is shaped by the unique logic of each world.

This archive includes journals, diagrams, belief statements, planetary records, taxonomies of sapient species, dimensional mechanics, and early experimental writings that helped form the setting.

## 📌 Fiction Notice

All material in this repository is **entirely fictional** and created for creative worldbuilding purposes.

Nothing here is intended to represent real people, real events, real tragedies, historical figures, organizations, religions, or factual claims about reality. Any resemblance is coincidental or used purely for narrative framing.

## 🕰️ Archival Intent

This repository functions as a long-term reference archive rather than a finished story. Some materials originate from early drafts or exploratory writing and have been preserved to document the evolution of the Furuniverse concept over time.

Future expansions may reorganize or refine this collection, but the contents here remain as a historical snapshot of the project’s development.
