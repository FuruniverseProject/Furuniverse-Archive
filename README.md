🌌 Furuniverse — Foundational Worldbuilding Archive

This repository preserves early and evolving creative material from the Furuniverse: a fictional multiversal setting exploring alternate realities, anthropomorphic civilizations, speculative planetary systems, dimensional structures, and unusual technologies.

Included here are long-form PDF volumes, raw handwritten notes, belief statements, experimental diagrams, planetary maps, and personal early-stage concepts presented as part of a fictional archive.
