# 🌌 Furuniverse – Reality Basement Collection Archive

Creator: Rinty SkyCoyote

Universe: Furuniverse (Fictional Multidimensional Setting)

Type: Worldbuilding Archive / Creative Documentation

This repository contains documents, images, and text files related to the Furuniverse — a fictional multiversal setting focused on alternate realities, anthropomorphic civilizations, speculative technology, altered ecosystems, and divergent historical paths.

Included materials range from experimental journals and concept notes to structured archives that explore how life, wildlife and pests (including no kitites/pestites/pupites exist, and no Pest Xs/Pup Xs exist either) that are limited or stuble, vehicles, cities, and societies differ across dimensions. Some worlds are vast and abundant; others are more limited or subtle in their ecology and infrastructure — including the Furuniverse itself, which is constrained in certain ways but not fully closed or depleted.

This project is presented as creative documentation and speculative fiction, not as commentary on real-world people, governments, or historical events.

🕰️ Long-Term Archival Vision

This repository is part of a long-running creative project intended to grow over time. Copies may also be preserved through external archives such as Internet Archive and Notion for documentation, research, and historical reference.

If Furuniverse references appear elsewhere online in the future — independent of this repository — they represent the organic spread of a fictional setting rather than coordinated publication.

✨ Motto
Nothing is impossible.
