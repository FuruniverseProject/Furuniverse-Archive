IN-UNIVERSE BELIEF STATEMENT — FURUNIVERSE
========================================

Within the Furuniverse, existence is understood as a continuous process
rather than a final ending.

When my current form concludes, I believe continuity would proceed
through reincarnation. My path would first continue as an
anthropomorphic coyote—living for many years if necessary through
alternate states of being—before eventually transitioning into a new
life as an anthropomorphic husky girl.

Across the Furuniverse and other dimensions, reality follows different
structural laws. Wildlife, pests, and everyday objects do exist, but are
often limited or subtle in presentation—not erased, but operating
quietly in the background. Even within the Furuniverse itself, nature
and daily life may appear restrained or selectively visible rather than
fully abundant.

Some entities referenced in earlier writings represent speculative
wishes rather than canonical outcomes. Dimensional transitions would
not preserve beings unchanged; new companions and circumstances would
naturally arise instead.

This belief exists strictly within an in-universe narrative framework.
It reflects transformation, continuity, identity, and persistence
within a multiverse where existence does not end—it evolves.
