Title: In-Universe Continuity & Reincarnation Statement

This document records a personal belief expressed entirely within the fictional framework of the Furuniverse. It describes a concept of continuity after death through reincarnation, beginning with existence as an anthropomorphic coyote and eventually transitioning into a new life as an anthropomorphic husky girl.

It also explains how reality functions across the Furuniverse and neighboring dimensions, where wildlife, minor creatures, and everyday objects persist in quieter or more limited forms than in reality—never erased, but shaped by the internal rules of each world.

This file is not a real-world claim. It is part of a speculative multiversal narrative focused on identity, transformation, and persistence across dimensions.
